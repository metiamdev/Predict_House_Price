# Predict_House_Price

# House Price Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression 

# 1.Introduction 
The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on multiple features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, year built, lot size, garage size, and neighborhood quality.
<br>
We use Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to model the relationship between these independent features and the dependent variable (House_Price).

# 2.Dataset
he dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named house_price_regression_dataset.csv.
It contains the following columns : 
<br>
◉ Square_Footage → Total area of the house.
<br>
◉ Num_Bedrooms → Number of bedrooms
<br>
◉ Num_Bathrooms → Number of bathrooms
<br>
◉ Year_Built → Year when the house was built
<br>
◉ Lot_Size → Size of the lot.
<br>
◉ Garage_Size → Size of the garage
<br>
◉ Neighborhood_Quality → A score representing the quality of the neighborhood
<br>
◉ House_Price → Target variable (price of the house)
